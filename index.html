					<p class="lead mb-5"> I am a fourth year graduate student at the department of <a href="https://stat-or.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Statistics and Operations Research</a> at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
					My primary field of work is on large deviations theory, under the direction of <a href="https://abudhiraja.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Amarjit Budhiraja</a>. </p>
					
					<p class="lead mb-5"> Before that, I obtained my undergraduate degree from the department of Mathematics of the University of Athens. Particularly influential for my decision to pursue graduate studies were my two semesters studying mathematics abroad: one at <i>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</i> in Florida, and one at <i>Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin</i>.

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Research</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-5"> My primary area of focus is Large Deviations theory, which pertains to the asymptotic behavior of probabilities that decay exponentially fast. 
					                      An effective strategy for identifying such asymptotics involves starting with a variational formula of exponential moments of functionals of a random quantity,
  										  such as a finite-dimensional Brownian motion, an empirical measure, or an infinite-dimensional Brownian motion. Proving large deviations principles requires demonstrating two inequalities: 
										  the Laplace Upper and Lower bounds. My dissertation topic is proving Large Deviations principles for some models with asymptotically vanishing noise.
										  </p>
					<p class="lead mb-5"> Parallel to my work in large deviations theory, I am thinking about some probabilistic and statistical aspects of stochastic processes. The first topic I considered was dimensionality reduction for data of non Euclidean nature, for which
					                      standard principal component analysis often underperforms. Consider, for example, data on a torus, i.e. vectors of angles, where
					                      PCA disregards the periodicity of the data. My work on this field was to develop an algorithm that performs dimensionality reduction on the torus. 
										  More recently and thanks to a Research Assistantship by <a href="https://pipiras.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Vladas Pipiras</a>, I have started working on some topics in long range dependence and time series analysis. A first topic considered
                                          was the construction of confidence intervals for the variance of stationary time series data that are generated with cyclical long memory. We are currently trying to understand better the behavior of such stochastic processes.  </p>

<p class="lead mb-5"> <b> Here are a few of the anonymous evaluations I have received as a lab instructor (evidence can be provided upon request): </b> <br>
 <center> <q class="lead mb-5"> Pavlos was an amazing guy. Made me want to understand the material and was really good at answering my question if I had any. I hope he becomes a teacher someday, he has been my favorite TA throughout my four years at Carolina. </q>  </center> <br>
 <center> <q class="lead mb-5">I believe Pavlos recognized Prof. XXX's teaching style was difficult, and did everything he could in the realm of his role to ease that pain. He was a funny guy, which made the lab much more bearable.
Pavlos was always super kind and super helpful. Truly a blessing of a teaching assistant. </q>  </center> </p>

<p class="lead mb-5"> <b> And if you still think I'm a bad teacher, I hope I can at least convince you my classes are amusing: </b> <br>
<center> <q class="lead mb-5"> The extra questions in the attendance was great. They were super biased and random and I loved it.</q> </center> <br>
<center> <q class="lead mb-5"> Pavlos was a great TA! He was very prompt with grading, which is very appreciated. Lab sections were always well–structured but he was also very flexible when it came to any difficulties students might have with turning in assignments on time, which was appreciated in an unpredictable semester. He was so personable and friendly, and his sense of humor brightened my mornings.
